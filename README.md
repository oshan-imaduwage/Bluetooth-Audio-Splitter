## MercAp - Bluetooth Audio Splitter

Our device functions as a wireless Bluetooth splitter connecting multiple devices simultaneously. The user first pairs their mobile phone (or any other appropriate Bluetooth output device) and then pairs up to 4 Bluetooth earbuds, allowing them to hear seamless audio streams at once.
